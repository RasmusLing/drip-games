        <p> ABOUT : <br>Matching games are games that require players to match similar elements. <br>
         Participants need to find a match for a word, picture, or card. For example,<br>
         students place 30 word cards; composed of 15 pairs, face down in random order. <br>
         Each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a <br>
         matching pair, by using their memory.</p>
